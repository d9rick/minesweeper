# Minesweeper
Old project of mine where I wrote Minesweeper in C++. Was mostly a test of my understanding of BFS and object oriented programming.

# Functionality
I have not done extensive bugtesting, but I have been able to play and finish a few games with this engine.
I intend to extend this at some point to contain a solver, but currently it is just the game.

# Compilation
```g++ -g -Wall -Wextra minesweeperTest.cpp minesweeper.cpp -o minesweeper```
